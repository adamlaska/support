title: Can I use IPv6 on my relay?
---
description:
Tor [has partial support for IPv6](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/IPv6Features) and we encourage every relay operator to [enable IPv6 functionality](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide#IPv6) in their [torrc](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-editing-torrc/) configuration files when IPv6 connectivity is available.
For the time being Tor will require IPv4 addresses on relays, you can not run a Tor relay on a host with IPv6 addresses only.
